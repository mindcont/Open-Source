      Skeltrack is a library that tracks the human skeleton joints from
      depth images.
    </para>

    <para>
      Its main purpose is to offer an easy way to track and identify a
      number of joints of the human skeleton from depth images.
      It provides an easy to use asynchronous API and different aspects
      of the algorithm used can be tweaked by simply changing some properties.

    <para>
      Skeltrack intends to provide also a synchronous API, but it is still
      work in progress.
